    "\n",
    "1. **NO AI TOOLS**: You may **NOT** use ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, GitHub Copilot, or any other AI assistant to generate code for this assignment. The goal is to build *your* fundamental skills. If you rely on AI now, the advanced topics later will be impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Study Groups Encouraged**: You **ARE** encouraged to discuss ideas, share approaches, and explain concepts to your study group peers. Teaching others is the best way to learn! However, the code you submit must be **your own work**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Your Resources**: You are free to use Google, StackOverflow, Pandas/Scikit-learn documentation, and your class notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comment Your Code**: Include comments explaining *why* you're doing what you're doing. I want to see your thought process.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Resubmission**: You may submit this assignment multiple times for feedback before each checkpoint deadline.\n",

    "Don't just write one-word answers or skip these sections. Your reflections demonstrate:\n",
